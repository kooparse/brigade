I’m an enthusiastic French front-end developer.</p><p>I discovered Brigade a few months ago and I am very moved by what you’re doing. We live in a 21st-century society but our political system is still based on an information technology that does not respond to our current needs and is extremely outdated.<br>In my opinion, democracy shouldn’t be a matter of voting once every couple of years; there needs to be a bigger and more frequent involvement in order to not disenfranchise people or exclude them for the political and social arena.<br>I think that our political system can be transformed by rewiring it with the tools that Internet provides for us.<br>I notice more and more of my friends and peers are feeling powerless in the face of political change and feel overwhelmed and disconnected. The challenge we face today is to find, to design, to create and to empower those connectors that are able to transform noise and silence into signal. I am convinced that Brigade is making a huge step toward this purpose. This is why I want to be part of your team.</p><br><p>Let me tell you a bit more about myself and my journey so far!</p><p>I love coding for mostly one reason: It gives me a limitless power to create whatever I have in my head. There is such a powerful feeling that comes from creating something out of nothing and I believe in the sheer power of team work and collaboration. I would love to be a part of the team.</p><p>I lived in San Francisco for 8 months during my third year of school (Masters in computer science). It is a town for misfits; a place where ideas become global movements, trends or even a way of life.<br>I met incredible people, with that same vision of the world than me. It was a mind opener for me, I deeply fell in love with SF and I’m still very connected to it.</p><p>I moved to Montreal for my fourth year. I decided to work at a cool enthusiastic startup, so I decided to leave my school to work with wavo instead. My 10 months at <a href="https://www.wavo.me/">Wavo</a> was really great. I worked with two awesome senior developers, I learned a LOT from them. I was on both sides (front/back). I played with Backbone/jQuery/(React a little bit) and Express/Mongodb/Redis.</p><p>I moved to Paris and worked one year at <a href="https://www.glose.com/">Glose</a>. It is a collective platform for reading books. You can discuss quotes with your friends and see your friend’s annotations as inline comments. You get an augmented edition of your books. I first played with Laravel/Backbone/jQuery then React/Redux!</p><p>I also worked on <a href="https://www.bookshots.com/">BookShots</a> while I was at Glose. It is a little platform that let readers discover, purchase, and read BookShots ebooks and audiobooks across all devices.</p><br><p>I open sourced some personal projects. The notable one is <a href="https://github.com/kooparse/getsub-desktop">Getsub</a>, it is an app where you can rapidly and easily get your movies or TV shows subtitles. The project is made with Electron, React, Redux and CSS modules. Everything is open sourced on Github!</p><br><p>I think it would be a great feature if everyone in the brigade community had the possiblity to add contexts and medias on already live debate. It would empower the debate, give a solid source regarding the issue and enable a more constructive discussion regarding that subject.<br><br>For example:<br><img src="https://github.com/kooparse/brigade/blob/master/statics/example.png?raw=true" class="example"> Here, we would like to know the average salary of educators, why we need to pay them more, how this would be possible. Links to articles that give us answers to those questions should be highlighted on the debate card.</p><br><br><p>Now that you know more about me, I would love to hear back from you, please do not hesitate to contact me for further information!</p><p>Also I love this quote: <i>“Democracy must be something more than two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.” — James Bovard</i></p><br><ul><li><a href="https://www.brigade.com/profiles/alex-c">Brigade profile</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kooparse">Github profile</a></li><li><a href="http://kooparse.com">My website</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kooparse">Twitter account</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@kooparse">Medium account</a></li><li></li></ul><br><p>Feel free to ask me anything!<br>I hope to hear from you very soon! :)</p><br><p>Alexandre Chêne.</p><div class="vote"><div class="vote--box"><span class="icon green"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M17 11h-4V7c0-.55-.45-1-1-1s-1 .45-1 1v4H7c-.55 0-1 .45-1 1s.45 1 1 1h4v4c0 .55.45 1 1 1s1-.45 1-1v-4h4c.55 0 1-.45 1-1s-.45-1-1-1" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg> </span>Agree</div><div class="vote--box"><span class="icon red"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M7 13c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1s.45-1 1-1h10c.55 0 1 .45 1 1s-.45 1-1 1H7z" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg> </span>Disagree</div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="./dist/bundle.82cc6df79f466a4f155e.js"></script></body></html>
